# Your Mission

You are going to write a compelling tutorial titled:\
\# **How Markdown Works**

By the end, you’ll have: 
- A clean, professional GitHub repository 
- A detailed, well-formatted tutorial 
- Your own authored Markdown showcase

This document gives you **scaffolded prompts** and **examples**. Fill in
the explanations yourself. Render often using GitHub’s preview.

# Setup Checklist

- [ ] Create a private GitHub repo named `how-markdown-works`
- [ ] Add a `README.md` file
- [ ] Edit in GitHub online (✏️ button)
- [ ] Use **Preview** tab to view how your writing renders

---

# Essential Elements

These are **required** for a professional finish:

## Add a Cover Image

Place this right below your main heading:

```markdown
![Cover Image](images/cover.png)
```

If you don’t have an image, you can use a free placeholder:

```markdown
![Cover](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200?text=How+Markdown+Works)
```

Markdown uses the exclamation mark `!` followed by `[alt text]` and a URL in parentheses.  
Alt text helps visually impaired readers or anyone viewing the raw file.  
GitHub automatically loads online image URLs or local image files stored in your repo.

## Build a Table of Contents

Link to key sections within your README using anchor links or cross-file
links.

Example:

```markdown
## Table of Contents

- [Introduction](#your-mission)
- [Headings](#headings)
- [Emphasis](#emphasis-italic-bold)
- [Code](#code)
- [Tables](tables.md)
- [Images](images.md)
- [Reflections](#reflections)
```

Anchor links begin with `#` followed by the lowercase, hyphenated version of your heading text.  
This makes navigation smooth, especially for long tutorials.

---

# Write Your Tutorial Sections

Each section must:
1. Start with a heading (e.g., `## How Headings Work`)
2. Explain in your own words
3. Show example code using triple backticks (```` ``` ````)
4. Show the rendered result after the code block

---

## Headings

> [GFM Spec — ATX Headings](https://github.github.com/gfm/#atx-headings)

Markdown uses the hash symbol `#` to create headings.  
The number of `#` symbols corresponds to the heading level — one `#` for the largest title, up to six for the smallest.  
This system keeps your writing structured and easy to navigate.  
Headings also generate automatic anchors in GitHub, making them perfect for linking within a README.

````markdown
# H1
## H2
### H3
````

## Emphasis (Italic, Bold)

> [GFM — Emphasis](https://github.github.com/gfm/#emphasis-and-strong-emphasis)

To draw attention to words, you can emphasize them using single or double asterisks or underscores.  
Use one (`*` or `_`) for italic text and two (`**` or `__`) for bold text.  
This makes your content visually clearer and helps highlight important terms.

````markdown
*italic*  **bold**  _also italic_  __also bold__
````

## Code

> [GFM — Code Blocks](https://github.github.com/gfm/#fenced-code-blocks)

Code formatting in Markdown comes in two forms:  
- Use single backticks for `inline code` — short snippets inside sentences.  
- Use triple backticks for code blocks — longer examples spanning multiple lines.  
You can also specify the language (like `python` or `r`) for syntax highlighting.

````markdown
`inline code`

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello!")
```
````

## Blockquotes

> [GFM — Blockquotes](https://github.github.com/gfm/#block-quoting)

Blockquotes are used to indicate quoted text, commentary, or special callouts.  
They begin with a greater-than symbol `>` at the start of a line.  
Nested blockquotes can be created with multiple `>` characters.

````markdown
> This is a quote.
````

## Lists

> [GFM — Lists](https://github.github.com/gfm/#list-items)

Lists help organize information.  
Use dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`) for unordered lists, and numbers for ordered ones.  
Indent with two spaces to create nested lists.

````markdown
- Item A
  - Nested Item
1. First
2. Second
````

## Links

> [GFM — Links](https://github.github.com/gfm/#links)

Links use square brackets for the text and parentheses for the URL.  
You can also add a title (hover text) in quotes after the URL.

````markdown
[Visit OpenAI](https://www.openai.com)
````

# Tables & Images

## Tables

> [GFM — Tables](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension)

Tables allow you to organize data into rows and columns using pipes `|` and dashes `-`.  
Align columns using colons `:` — left (`:---`), right (`---:`), or center (`:---:`).

````markdown
| Name  | Score |
|-------|-------:|
| Alice | 98    |
| Bob   | 87    |
````

## Images

> [GFM — Images](https://github.github.com/gfm/#images)

Images follow the same syntax as links, but with an exclamation mark at the start.  
Always include descriptive alt text for accessibility.

````markdown
![Example](https://via.placeholder.com/150)
````

# Advanced Markdown

## Badges

> [shields.io](https://shields.io)

Badges are small status icons used to display project info — such as build status, version, or repo size.  
They’re added as images with URLs pointing to shields.io.

````markdown
![GitHub repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/yourname/how-markdown-works)
````

## Collapsible Sections

Collapsible sections are great for keeping your README tidy.  
They use HTML `<details>` and `<summary>` tags and work seamlessly within Markdown.

````markdown
<details>
<summary>Click to reveal</summary>

Hidden content inside.

</details>
````

## Task Lists

Task lists are interactive checkboxes supported in GitHub READMEs.  
They’re perfect for progress tracking or project planning.

````markdown
- [x] Done
- [ ] To do
````

## Tip Blocks (Callouts)

> [GitHub Callouts Info](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-05-19-markdown-task-lists-tables-and-more-are-now-supported-in-comments/)

You can create attention-grabbing callouts using blockquotes with emojis or bold labels.  
They’re perfect for quick tips or reminders.

````markdown
> Tip: You can preview your Markdown as you write by clicking the "Preview" tab above.
````

# Multipage Navigation

Large tutorials benefit from splitting into multiple files.  
You can link to other Markdown pages in your repo, just like web links.

````markdown
[Next → Tables](tables.md)
````

# Reflections

Write these at the end to consolidate your learning:

````markdown
# Reflections

- What surprised you?
- What helped you learn Markdown faster?
- What still confuses you?
- How will you use Markdown in the future?
````

# Showcase Polish

- Make sure your cover image is working  
- Check that your table of contents links work  
- Use spacing and headings consistently  
- Make your opening paragraph shine:

````markdown
> This tutorial was written by me to demonstrate my understanding of Markdown syntax on GitHub. All examples show the source code and its rendered output.
````

This statement makes your project look professional and portfolio-ready.

# Stretch Yourself

- Add a GIF (record your screen using Loom or OBS, then embed it as an image)
- Try inserting math:
  ````markdown
  $E = mc^2$
  ````
- Try styling tables with HTML (advanced)
- Create a [profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/about-your-profile) at `yourusername/yourusername`


# Practice Assignment: Recreate a Professional README like Ultralytics

This is an **advanced Markdown assignment** inspired by the popular [Ultralytics GitHub repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). You’ll create a **professional, multi-feature README** for a fictional software library using **only raw Markdown directly in GitHub** — no Quarto, no VSCode, just GitHub’s in-browser editor.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this assignment, you will:

- Understand how advanced GitHub READMEs are structured
- Use badges, tables, images, collapsibles, and links
- Create a README that looks professional and is portfolio-ready
